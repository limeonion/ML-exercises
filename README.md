# Machine Learning Exercises
Extra self-starter projects to ractice machine learning

Breakdown of projects:-

1. Calculation of Mean, Variance, Log-likelihood for a small data-set (Statistical analysis)
2. Gradient Descent on the LeToR dataset.
3. Logistic Regression, Single Layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network to classify handwritten digits from the USPS dataset after training on MNIST.
4. CNN for classification on the CelebA dataset.
